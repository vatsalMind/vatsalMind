  ## Tech Tidbit 🎮

  In the realm of coding, there's a quirky tradition known as "Rubber Duck Debugging." 🦆👨‍💻 Developers often explain code problems to a rubber duck on their desk. The act of articulating the issue helps   them find the solution! It's like a duck's magical powers transform complex code into simplicity. 🌟✨
